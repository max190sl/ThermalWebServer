# Temperature Web Server

The idea is to have a simple web server that shows temperature.
The web server is hosted by a Raspberry Pi and based on Python's Flask library.
The temperature sensor is connected to one of the analog to digital converters on an Arduion Uno.
The Arduino and Raspberry Pi are connected via a USB cable.
